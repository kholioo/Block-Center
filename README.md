introduction

For a long time, the process of registration of assets and ownership by
central authorities on paper documents has been verified by the government
under the supervision of the third party, which is called the centralization of
the transaction. The process of managing the property by persons who
authenticate the transfers and attribution of ownership by recording the
transfers in a list is recorded in an encrypted block without governmental
intervention These lists will be distributed on many computers and the
authorized ones will be responsible for verifying the process and registering
them on the network

Therefore, in terms of centralization in dealing and paper recording of
documents led to many problems of forgery and corruption, as it emerged
many problems of fraud and corruption, in addition to that emerged many
problems of ownership dispute and the time and effort spent for sale and
purchase and registration of property either in the non-centralized was
limited to the market Digital currencies, which are the source of information
are registered persons for transfers and authenticated, which leads to
problems in privacy and integrity as it is rejected by many governments and
therefore the courts because of the problems in identifying the identity of
the converter and also that the bumper The information is not reliable and
thus achieving the objective of decentralization is limited due to lack of
recognition. Technically, there are safety problems because of the public and
private keys which, if known, will become a major problem. The structure of
the data does not regulate the data recording process and leads to a large
consumption of energy. Automated computers where all data must be
parsed in a distributed list to validate client data

51%attacks
The Proof of Work consensus algorithm that protects the Bitcoin blockchain
has proven to be very efficient over the years. However, there are a few
potential attacks that can be performed against blockchain networks and
51% attacks are among the most discussed. Such an attack may happen if one
entity manages to control more than 50% of the network hashing power,
which would eventually allow them to disrupt the network by intentionally

. excluding or modifying the ordering of transactions

Despite being theoretically possible, there was never a successful 51% attack
on the Bitcoin blockchain. As the network grows larger the security increases
and it is quite unlikely that miners will invest large amounts of money and
resources to attack Bitcoin as they are better rewarded for acting honestly.
Other than that, a successful 51% attack would only be able to modify the
most recent transactions for a short period of time because blocks are linked
through cryptographic proofs (changing older blocks would require intangible
levels of computing power). Also, the Bitcoin blockchain is very resilient and

. would quickly adapt as a response to an attack

Private keys
Blockchain uses public-key (or asymmetric) cryptography to give users
ownership over their cryptocurrency units (or any other blockchain data).
Each blockchain account (or address) has two corresponding keys: a public
key (which can be shared) and a private key (which should be kept secret).
Users need their private key to access their funds, meaning that they act as
their own bank. If a user loses their private key, the money is effectively lost,

. and there is nothing they can do about it

Inefficient
Blockchains, especially those using Proof of Work, are highly inefficient. Since
mining is highly competitive and there is just one winner every ten minutes,
the work of every other miner is wasted. As miners are continually trying to
increase their computational power, so they have a greater chance of finding
a valid block hash, the resources used by the Bitcoin network has increased
significantly in the last few years, and it currently consumes more energy

. than many countries, such as Denmark, Ireland, and Nigeria

The process of recording and trading the assets we have is a complicated
process that consumes time, effort and dependence on the third party in
carrying out the operations, in addition to the lack of safety, which led to the
emergence of fraud and corruption and although the financial services
market has developed in terms of ease of dealing but safety standards weak
Resulting in a lot of hacking operations after entering the online financial
services market

Mechanization of the assets of citizens to a series of encrypted databases,
which lists the assets and health certificates and the national definition and
can be recorded data of the citizens can not tamper with it because of the
link to the sequence of encryption for each list of assets in the language of
encryption is upset and the exchange of assets in the consensus process as
the whole process Without the intervention of human and through
processors without the need to go to government agencies or the bank (third
party) This gives the most secure in the field of the Internet, which enters the
era of the fourth generation is Internet of things and assets where the
process is shared by A lot of citizens and institutions concerned with these
assets and data can not change or tampering with databases in addition to
the impossibility of piracy because of the process of consensus, which can
reach one to tens of thousands of electronic devices (smart hour) to ensure
the validity of the process
The asset list data is saved in hashed block in SHA256 Which is impossible
to return any source of information again, in addition to that each block
linked to each other in the language of encryption, which prevents tampering
with this information , this blockchain database is distributed in processors of
e-wallets
That validate in any transmission process without human intervention that
prevent hacking system.
The block chain database is divided into rows and columns where every
citizen have blockchain data that prevent blockchain fork.

This process is execute by E-wallets ,SPW network and SPW protocol
Which represents a more secure and streamlined process and is a factor in
the field of information and financial services, real estate and government.

Where we take the step in mixing the central system with distributed
data, where we all contribute to the creation of a strong system to prevent

piracy of information and make it easier to deal economically and materially
on the Internet with all confidence and security.

Through this system, governments can eliminate corruption and reduce
civil cases in the courts and through smart contracts where contracting
parties are required by the entire community to obligate to contract term It
also establishes the principle of trust among them.

Smart contracting process, which obliges the parties to the contract to apply
the terms of the contract where the code is a control in the series of asset
lists, which pass transfer orders and the application of conditions without the
consumption of time and effort or intervention by government agencies and
courts

The Block Center system is based on five main axes: the network (a mixture
of central and distributed data), the device (smart watch) and the source of
the information (government servers), the validators (processors) and the
protocol where the smart wallet processors are competent to access the
information to authenticate it, Central is organized and completed by the
process of insurance and integrity, providing the citizen with all financial
services, property management and assets in his hand, where the data of the
assets, national identification, health certificates, etc. are made for the
individual citizen in a genesis block from the governmental and central
authorities, In a series of asset lists where the operations protocol, which
regulates and secures the conversion and contracting processes and tool (E-
wallet), which distributes the data from the main server where the only force
have processors that in the process of validation in coordination with the
core server, servers, and other relevant data and that network spw

Data distribution
Each validator has in his E-WALLET blockchain database and its hash
refrence content boxs for all the agents in its network to which he
belongs and is the only outlet to the smart wallet processor to carry
out the process of validation.
- main server S :
Have all block chain database and its hash refrence
- server of the bank sb:
it owns asset blockchain database(currency) for the clients who deal
with him and only its content hash refrence.
The competent authority of the property documents sc:
Owns asset list chains that belong to its customers and where the
boxes of documented assets are available and its content hash
refrence.
- Traffic Authority server st:
It owns chains of asset lists belonging to its customers in which box
Assets (the ownership of the car – the identification number of the
car) are documented to them available and its content hash
refrence.
- center server s:
it owns chains of assets lists belonging to all servers s of different
countries and its hash refrence.

- protocol of swc:

1 - distributed block chain:

- E-wallet distributed:
In which each list contains the block chain for one E-wallet and the
server s is this process to compare cryptographic hash value of the
lists for validation of safety.
- newly added content hash refrence box:
Servers execute comparing process on each content boxs raised by
e-wallets after transmission

2 - The mechanism of consensus:
When the transfer of the money or the transfer of ownership of the
asset of the client's E-wallet, each processor located in the network
verify the ownership of the asset and when the percentage of
confirmation of 100% of the validators where the coordination
between the main server and the server of authority to ownership of
asset by signature operation.

e-wallet code e-wallet code e-wallet code
3 - transmission and validation process:
When e-wallet execute transmission it send to server which role is
ordered other e-wallets to validate the content of asset list by
1 - validate public private key (decryption)

2 - if it is valid the e-wallets validate asset list to both transmission
parties

3 - each e-wallet form new asset list and its corresonding block with
new data to both parties and execute signature process , proof of
security and RSA (public Private Key Secure)

4 - each e-wallet raise up the newly content hash reference box to
server and add new corresponding block to its data

5 - the server execute comparing process to both (new content hash
reference box –added corresponding block) by

- (for content hash reference boxes) by comparing its content in
SHA 256 if values are equal to each other and corresponding
blocks=valid—and validate signature of box
- (for newly added corresponding block) by comparing cryptography
hash value

6 - the server confirms the process and newly added data

4 - signature process:
This signature is executed by e-wallets in transmission and
validation process
The signature is added to newly content hash refrence box as proof
of work

- for ex:
If value of transmission 150 L.E the signature will be

By publicKey key encrypted(column chain)
5 - proof of security:

Every data type have document id during insert it to block chain =
SHA256(data items)

 every node make the same mechanism in hashing data items

And comparison the output hash with document id

Every block in block chain when added it hashed by
SHA256(block + Root of down or previousHash)

 every node make the same mechanism in hashing block

And comparison the output hash with hash of block

every node comparison the previous hash with previous block

hash in row and the down hash with down block hash in column

6 - RSA(public private key):

as mentioned every user have his block chain (column chain)
And every user have his own(public-private key)

every columnchain is encrypted by publick key
And only user have the authorization to decrypt it y private key

7 - watcher function:

- every node have watcher function that based on timestamp job which

do proof of security ,encrypted block chain , contract obligation

block center services:

Applications of Block center:
Financial Services
Traditional systems tend to be cumbersome, error-prone and
maddeningly slow. Intermediaries are often needed to mediate the
process and resolve conflicts. Naturally, this costs stress, time, and
money. In contrast, users find the block center cheaper, more
transparent, and more effective. Small wonder that a growing number
of financial services are using this system to introduce innovations,
such as smart bonds and smart contracts. The former automatically
pays bondholders their coupons once certain preprogrammed terms
are met. The latter are digital contracts that self-execute and self-
maintain, again when terms are met.
Asset Management: Trade Processing and Settlement
Traditional trade processes within asset management (where parties
trade and manage assets) can be expensive and risky, particularly
when it comes to cross-border transactions. Each party in the process,
such as broker, custodian, or the settlement manager, keeps their own
records which create significant inefficiencies and room for error. The
blockchain ledger reduces error by encrypting the records. At the
same time, the ledger simplifies the process, while canceling the need
for intermediaries.

Insurance: Claims processing
Claims processing can be a frustrating and thankless procedure.
Insurance processors have to wade through fraudulent claims,
fragmented data sources, or abandoned policies for users to state a
few – and process these forms manually. Room for error is huge. The
block center provides a perfect system for risk-free management and
transparency. Its encryption properties allow insurers to capture the
ownership of assets to be insured.

3.
Payments: Cross-Border Payments
The global payments sector is error-prone, costly, and open to money
laundering. It takes days if not longer for money to cross the world.
The block center is already providing solutions with remittance
companies such as Abra, Align Commerce and Bitspark that offer
end-to-end block center powered remittance services.

Smart Property
A tangible or intangible property, such as cars, houses, or cookers, on
the one hand, or patents, property titles, or company shares, on the
other, can have smart technology embedded in them. Such
registration can be stored on the ledger along with contractual
details of others who are allowed ownership in this property. Smart
keys

could be used to facilitate access to the permitted party. The
ledger stores and allows the exchange of these smart keys once the
.contract is verified

The decentralized ledger also becomes a system for recording and
managing property rights as well as enabling the smart contracts to
.be duplicated if records or the smart key is lost

Making property smart decreases your risks of running into fraud,
mediation fees, and questionable business situations. At the same
time, it increases trust and efficiency
1.
Unconventional money lenders/ hard money lending
Smart contracts can revolutionize the traditional lending system. For
instance, unconventional money lenders (e.g. hard money lenders)
service borrowers who have poor credit with needed loans – while
charging two to ten percent of the loan amount and claiming their
property as collateral. Too many borrowers fall into bankruptcy and
lose homes. The block center can undercut this by allowing a stranger
to loan you money and taking your smart property as collateral. No
need to show the lender credit or work history. No need to manually
process the numerous documents. The property’s encoded on the
block center to ensure from assets
2.
Your car/ smart phone
Primitive forms of smart property exist. Your car-key, for instance,
may be outfitted with an immobilizer, where the car can only be
activated once you tap the right protocol on the key. Your smart
phone too will only function once you type in the right PIN code.
Both work on cryptography to protect your ownership.
The problem with primitive forms of smart property is that the key is
usually held in a physical container, such as the car key or SIM card,
and can’t be easily transferred or copied.
3.
Internet-of-Things (IoT)
Any material object is a ‘thing.’ It becomes an internet of things (IoT)
when it has an on/ off switch that connects it to the internet and to
each other. By being connected to a computer network, the object,
such as a car, become more than just an object. It is now people-
people, people-things, and things-things. The analyst firm Gartner
says that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices.
Others raise that number to over 100!
How does the IoT affect you? Your printer can automatically order
cartridges from Amazon when it runs low. Your alarm clock will
change your time for brewing coffee, while your oven will produce an
immaculately timed turkey for Thanksgiving. These are just some
examples. On a larger scale, cities and governments can use IoT to
develop cleaner environments, more efficient energy use and so-
called ‘smart cities,’ to improve how we live and work.with the
labels. Players would be paid with digital currency according to the
specified terms of the contract.

4.
Voting processor :
Where the right to vote is recorded in the list of assets owned by the
citizen.

5.
Public value/ community
The block center can facilitate self-organization by providing a self-
management platform for companies, NGOs, foundations,
government agencies, academics, and individual citizens. Parties can
interact and exchange information on a global and transparent scale –
think of Google Cloud, but larger and less risky.

6.
Block center identity
Passports
The first digital passport launched on Github in 2014 and could help
owners identify themselves online and off. How does it work? You
take a picture of yourself, stamp it with a public and private key, both

of which are encoded to prove it is legitimate. The passport is stored
on the ledger, given a, and confirmed by Block center users.

Birth, wedding, and death certificates
Few things are more important than documents showing you’re born,
married, died which open your rights to all sorts of privileges (such as
voting, working, citizenship), yet mismanagement is rife. Up to a
third of children under the age of five have not been issued a birth
certificate, the UNICEF reported in 2013. The block center could
make record-keeping more reliable by encrypting birth and death
certification and empowering citizens to access this crucial
information.

Personal Identification
We carry a range of identifications: Our driver’s license, computer
password, identity cards, keys, social security ID, and so forth. Block
center ID is a digital form of ID that’s engineered to replace all these
forms of physical identification. In the future, fintech scientists say
you’ll be able to use the one digital ID for signing up at any registrar.
It is open source, secured by the block center, and protected by a
ledger of transparent account.

This is a offline tool, your data stays locally and is not send to any server!
